## What is this?
For AlchemyHacks, we decided to take a unique approach to running a hackathon. We made a video game, and your job is to code up a tutorial for the video game. This repository is the code for our game!

## How to download and run the source code?
Download the code! To get the source code, you can download git and use git clone, github desktop, or just download the code as a .ZIP file. You'll need python installed: [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Then, after installing python, open command prompt and run:

If you've already installed these packages, but are running into errors still, you can update python and update the installed packages.

## What to do?
